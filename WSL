When you're working inside WSL, the **best practice is very clear**:  
**Always create your Pipenv environments inside the Linux filesystem — not inside `/mnt/c` or any Windows-mounted directory.**

Here’s why this matters.

---

## ✅ **Where to create your Pipenv?**
**Use:**  
`/home/<your-username>/your-project/`

**Avoid:**  
`/mnt/c/...` (or any Windows-mounted folder)

---

## 🚀 **Why Linux filesystem is the right choice**
### **1. Massive performance difference**
WSL is optimized for Linux-native paths.  
Running Python, Pipenv, virtualenv, or Git inside `/mnt/c` is **significantly slower** because every file operation crosses the Windows–Linux boundary.

### **2. Fewer permission issues**
Windows file permissions don’t map cleanly to Linux.  
Inside `/mnt/c`, you often hit:
- Permission denied errors  
- Symlink failures  
- Pipenv lockfile inconsistencies  

### **3. Python packages behave correctly**
Many Python packages compile native Linux extensions.  
These break or behave unpredictably when installed on Windows-mounted paths.

### **4. Cleaner environment management**
Pipenv stores virtualenvs under:
`~/.local/share/virtualenvs/`  
This works perfectly when your project is inside `/home`.

## 🧭 **Recommended workflow**
### **Step 1: Create a project folder inside WSL**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/myapp
cd ~/projects/myapp
```

### **Step 2: Initialize Pipenv**
```bash
pipenv install
```

### **Step 3: Activate**
```bash
pipenv shell
```

## 📝 **When to use `/mnt/c`**
Only for:
- Editing code with Windows editors (VS Code handles this automatically)
- Sharing files between Windows and WSL

But **never** for Python environments or package installs.
